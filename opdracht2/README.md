# Responsive navigation

This component is a simple navigation that shifts to a hamburger menu on small screens. The menu is generated by Javascript and will fall back to a more basic css only menu if the needed Javascript isn't supported.

## Testing

The component works in most modern browsers. From internet explorer 9 and down it will fall back to the CSS menu.

## CSS Fallbacks

New CSS property fallback to more widely supported properties.

```
nav>ul li {
  display: block;
  display: flex;
}
```

## Feature detection

The hamburger menu works primarily with Javascript. For this reason the menu is styled from Javacript and the needed elements (open and close button) are added. This only happens when the browser supports eventlisteners.

Check if addEventListener is supported: `typeof nav.addEventListener === "function"`

## Device lab

I tested the navigation using the schools device lab. The navigation seemed to work on all the devices, as is shown below.

# Pop up modal

This component is a modal that opens when you click a link. Within the modal there is a fixed header with a 'close' button and a scrollable content section.

## Testing

The support for this component is roughly the same as the hamburger in modern browsers. IE9 and IE8 fail to properly show the modal.

## CSS Fallbacks

New CSS property fallback to more widely supported properties.

```
.dialog header div {
  display: block;
  display: flex;
}
```

## Feature detection

Check if eventlistener is available: `if (typeof modal.addEventListener === "function") {`

Check if the dialog tag is supported: `if ("open" in modal) {`

## Device lab

I tested the modal the same way I did the navigation. The modal works as intended on all the available devices.
