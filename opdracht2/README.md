# Responsive navigation
This component is a simple navigation that shifts to a hamburger menu on small screens. The menu is generated by Javascript and will fall back to a more basic css only menu if the needed Javascript isn't supported.

## Testing
The component works in most modern browsers. From internet explorer 9 and down it will fall back to the CSS menu. 

# Pop up modal
This component is a modal that opens when you click a link. Within the modal there is a fixed header with a 'close' button and a scrollable content section.

## Testing
The support for this component is roughly the same as the hamburger in modern browsers. IE9 and IE8 fail to properly show the modal.
