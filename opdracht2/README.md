# Responsive navigation
This component is a simple navigation that shifts to a hamburger menu on small screens. The menu is generated by Javascript and will fall back to a more basic css only menu if the needed Javascript isn't supported.

## Testing
The component works in most modern browsers. From internet explorer 9 and down it will fall back to the CSS menu. 

## Fallback
The hamburger menu works primarily with Javascript. For this reason the menu is styled from Javacript and the needed elements (open and close button) are added. This only happens when the browser supports eventlisteners.

# Pop up modal
This component is a modal that opens when you click a link. Within the modal there is a fixed header with a 'close' button and a scrollable content section.

## Testing
The support for this component is roughly the same as the hamburger in modern browsers. IE9 and IE8 fail to properly show the modal.

## Fallback
The Javascript test if the CSS is loaded and if so it enhances the modal. It enables clicking outside the modal to close it and it disables scrolling in the background. If the javascript isnt supported it will fallback to the basic :target modal.
